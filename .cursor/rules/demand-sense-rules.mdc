When working with this demand-sensing-backend project, utils should be imported at the top of Python files using the following pattern:

from utils.imports import *
from utils.config import *
from utils.decorators import *

Do not import individual functions from utils modules - always use the wildcard import pattern as shown above.

IMPORTANT: If you make changes to utils modules or add new modules:
1. When adding new external libraries, add them to imports.py
2. When adding configuration variables, add them to config.py
3. When adding decorators or wrapper functions, add them to decorators.py
4. If adding a new utils module, update this rule and inform team members to include the new import pattern

MERCHANT CENTER CONFIGURATION:
When working with merchant centers in this project, understand the difference between "code" and "mappedMarket":
- "code" represents the actual country or market code for the merchant center (e.g., "dk" for Denmark)
- "mappedMarket" is used when a merchant center's data should be treated as belonging to a different market for analysis purposes
- If "mappedMarket" is not specified, the system defaults to using the "code" value

- When querying data, use "code" for feed_label filtering in _products tables
- When filtering by market for analysis purposes (e.g., country_code in the bestseller tables), use "mappedMarket"

- When displaying data, the system will use "mappedMarket" if available, otherwise it falls back to "code"
